# BKVM - Visual Manager for Apache BookKeeper

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/diennea/bookkeeper-visual-manager.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/apache/bookkeeper)

Bookkeeper Visual Manager is an open source visual interface for [Apache
Bookkeeper](https://bookkeeper.apache.org/).

Features:
- Connect to a BookKeeper cluster (4.7+)
- Discover bookies and bookie status
- Search ledgers, using ledger metadata
- Inspect ledger metadata

Usecases:
- Inspect your BookKeeper cluster
- Check health of Bookies
- See which applications are using more resources
- Validate configuration of each application (check replication)
- See Clusterwide configuration

Roadmap:
- Support multi user access, multitenancy and multiple clusters
- Manage Bookies
- Manage replication
- Verify consistency of cluster
- Add advanced query functions
- Add API

## Overview

## Quickstart

### Requirements

In order to run BookKeeper Visual Manager you just need a Unix Machine and Java 8 runtime.

In order to develop BookKeeper Visual Manager you need Maven 3.6.x and Yarn.

### Using the provided release packages

Download a release package from github releases page.
Unzip the package

Configure the service by editing conf/server.properties
By default we will connect to ZooKeeper at localhost, like when you are using BookKeeper standalone.

Start the service

~~~~
bin/service server start
~~~~

Open your browser at
http://localhost:4500

Username and passwords are: admin/admin

#### Deploy the war application using Maven Jetty Plugin
~~~~
git clone https://github.com/diennea/bookkeeper-visual-manager.git
cd bookkeeper-visual-manager
mvn clean install -DskipTests
~~~~

To pass the Metadata Service URI connection string you have to set the system property
`bookkeeper.visual.manager.metadataServiceUri` or run the provided script in bin
folder.

~~~~
BVM_PORT=8080
BVM_SERVICEURI=zk+null://localhost:2181/ledgers

./bin/run_dev.sh $BVM_SERVICEURI $BVM_PORT
~~~~

#### Deploy the war application on container

You can also deploy the `target/bookkeeper-visual-manager-XX.XX.war` on your
container passing the `bookkeeper.visual.manager.metadataServiceUri` location in a system property.

#### Deploy the war application using Maven Jetty Runner

Download the jetty-runner jar available at [Maven
Central](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/eclipse/jetty/jetty-runner/).

~~~~
BVM_PORT=8080
BVM_WAR_PATH=path/to/warfile

# Environment Variable configuration
BVM_CONF_PATH=/path/to/conf java -jar jetty-runner.jar $BVM_WAR_PATH --port $BVM_PORT
~~~~

### Advanced configuration

In order to use a more advanced configuration you need to provide to the
application a key/value properties file. An example file is provided in the conf/ folder.
**The provided file can also be your Bookkeeper Server configuration.**

| Property             | Value                              |
|----------------------|------------------------------------|
| metadataServiceUri   | Location of the Bookkeeper Server. |
| zkConnectionTimeout  | First connection timeout.          |
| zkTimeout            | Zookeeper session timeout.         |

You can provide this file to the application in three ways:
1. **System Property**: bookkeeper.visual.manager.config.path
    ~~~~
    BVM_PORT=8080
    BVM_CONF_PATH=path/to/warfile

    mvn jetty:run \
        -Dbookkeeper.visual.manager.config.path=$BVM_CONF_PATH \
        -Djetty.http.port=$BVM_PORT
    ~~~~
2. **Environment Variable**: BVM_CONF_PATH
    ~~~~
    BVM_PORT=8080
    BVM_WAR_PATH=path/to/warfile

    BVM_CONF_PATH=path/to/conf java -jar jetty-runner.jar $BVM_WAR_PATH --port $BVM_PORT
    ~~~~
3. **Deployment Descriptor**: bookkeeper.visual.manager.config.path in the web.xml
    ~~~~
    <context-param>
        <param-name>bookkeeper.visual.manager.config.path</param-name>
        <param-value>path/to/file</param-value>
    </context-param>
    ~~~~
